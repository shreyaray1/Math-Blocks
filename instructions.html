        Welcome to MathBlocks! This game's purpose is to train your speed in
        solving algebra equations.<br /><br />
        There are 3 levels - easy, medium, and hard. The easy level contains
        simple linear equations where you solve for x, such as 2x - 3 = 9. The
        medium level contains quadratic equations which are slightly more
        difficult (they will only have one answer), such as x^2 + 2x + 1. The
        hard level is the most difficult and is consisted of other polynomials,
        such at x^3 - 8 = 0.<br /><br />Once you press the start button in the
        game, blocks with equations written on them will begin to drop. You have
        to answer them before they reach the bottom of the white box. There will
        be three radio buttons above each question, and if you pick the one with
        the right answer, a new equation will appear at the top once more. If you 
        pick the one with the wrong answer the equation box will disappear and you 
        will lose a life. The goal is to get the most correct answers before you 
        lose three lives. You lose a life if you cannot answer the question before 
        it reaches the ground.<br /><br />Have fun!
